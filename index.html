                            Hii~<br>
                            I made this website because I wanted somewhere where I could practice web design. I 
                            also needed a space to keep projects and stuff.<br><br>
                            I have a rare strain of a chronic disease called "parlus linutitus". This disease makes 
                            it so that i have to annouce that I use SASS/SCSS instead of CSS. In most cases, this disease 
                            causes the sufferer to randomly announce what distro of Linux they are currently using and
                            why you should use that distro over whatever OS you are using; whether that OS is Mac, Windows, 
                            or even another distro of Linux. This disease propagates most commonly in Arch Linux users.
